# Tensordock-GPU-Alert
TensorDock GPU Alert is a Python script that monitors GPU server availability on TensorDock. It identifies new servers, extracts details, and sends alerts via Telegram.

Welcome to this repository, This is a powerful tool designed to monitor the availability of GPU servers on the TensorDock Marketplace. This Python script continuously checks the marketplace and identifies new servers as they become available.

The script is designed to provide detailed information about each server, including the model of the GPU and its location. This allows users to quickly identify servers that meet their specific requirements.

One of the key features of this script is its integration with Telegram. When a new server is identified, the script automatically sends a message to a specified Telegram chat. This ensures that users are immediately notified of new servers, allowing them to react quickly to changes in availability.
